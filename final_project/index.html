    <h1>Sandra from Dallas</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Sandra Martinez Adams and I lived in San Diego for a good portion of my life.
      I never thought I would leave. After all, California is beautiful to the point of almost being
      irreplaceable. But after my husband retired it became harder and harder to keep our sime lifestyle.</p>

    <p>According to The Dallas Morning News, "" <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/economy/2018/12/14/dallas-fort-worth-leads-nation-in-people-relocations-so-how-many-new-residents-is-that-each-day/">Check the article here.</a> </p>

    <p>The article mentions talent transfer but what about culture transfer. One of my daughters biggest fears was that having lived in Los Angeles and San Diego,
    she wouldn't have access to the same type of restaurants, music and art shows sporting events.
    To her surprise what she founds was a vibrant and eclectic community. You can drive from city to city within the Dallas metro area and each city will have its own feel and vibe.
